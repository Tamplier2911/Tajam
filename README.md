# Tajam

Creative Design Ajency landing page.

## Overview

Rather than writing what were done, I'd write that I would still do if I had enough time:

- **header-links** - could change color depends on current page position.

- **js-docks** - ofcourse each component and utility function must have a js dock to make it easier for other people to navigate.

- **prop-types** - would be a great compliment.

- **image-optimization** - image optimization for retina devices with x2 pixel density are still not done.

- **fallback** - all styling are done with grid layout, it would be great to write fallback to flexbox.

- **redux** - enhance project with state management library, that would be overkill here.

- **animations** - would be a great cherry on top.

- **stylesheets** - a lot repetitive code, could be optimized even more.

- **components** - a lot of components could be shattered in to more micro-components.

- **profiling** - did some performance optimization but there is still more to be done.

- **unit-testing** - jest and enzyme are our best friends <3.

- **much-much-more** - is there no limit to perfection, could keep polishing, but we all value our time, right?
